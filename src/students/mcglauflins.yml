    # You have 1 paragraph to make a great impression, summarize your career.
    summary: I am someone who decided to start improving my life starting with changing crareer paths. College has been a huge part of my adult life now, and I decided to take a risk and learn to a new skill set unassociated to my college studies. Coding is something that I have always wanted to learn and work in, but I did not want to leave the long path I already set out for. I took a leap and fell in love. Learning to eventually become a full stack developer has been so reawrding and a perfect step in the new trail I am forging for my life. By June of 2022 I will be a certified full stack developer and eager to pursure a future carreer in the tech industry. I look forward to the future of my career and to my future coding endeavors.
